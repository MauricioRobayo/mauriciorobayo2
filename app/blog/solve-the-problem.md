_"If you think it would be cute to align all of the equals signs in your code, if you spend time configuring your window manager or editor, if you put unicode check marks in your test runner, if you add unnecessary hierarchies in your code directories, if you are doing anything beyond just solving the problem - you don't understand how fucked the whole thing is. No one gives a fuck about the glib object model. The only thing that matters in software is the experience of the user."_
